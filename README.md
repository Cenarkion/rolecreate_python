Role Name
=========

This is a simple python script, written by somebody with little understanding of Python.
It likely breaks many Python rules, standards and best practise; simply due to ignorance on my part.

Requirements
------------

Requires a Python3 environment.
Requires the requests module.
Requires a related 'secrets.py' file, populated with your GITHUB_TOKEN details.
Requires your git global configs to have been completed

Example
--------------

Save the script to somewhere in your path.
run it via
```
rolecreate -n <new role name>
```
This will create a new ansible role structure, populated with the standard files and directories.
It will init and push this to your github

Dependencies
------------

Python3
requests module
